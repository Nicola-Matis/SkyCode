SkyCode - Serenity Project (Basic Testing Framework for an Online-Store)

For my final project in the FastTrackIT QA Tester Accredited Course, I created a testing framework from scratch for an online store using Java, Serenity and jUnit. The project, called SkyCode, demonstrated my ability to apply the skills and knowledge I learned in
the course to a real-world scenario. By developing this testing framework, I gained handson experience with best practices in testing web applications and improved my proficiency in using technologies such as Serenity and jUnit.
